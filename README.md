# Illegal Building Techniques Mod

This mod was made for [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCClalcgGsY).
I would not recommend placing this in a modpack.
Feel free to fork this project if you want to add on to it.
Requires the [fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/).

*You may have to use the command* `/set block ~~~ illegal:(trapdoor name)` *to use the trapdoor block.*
